# Response Paper 1 (45%)

## Purpose and Calendar

The response paper is a short analytical essay (about 1,000 to 1,200 words) where you show that you have understood and can think critically about the readings discussed in class. It is not a summary but a piece of analytical writing: you explain what the authors argue, how they reason, and what their ideas teach us about globalization.

You will receive two readings in Week 5.  
Both will come from the materials studied between Week 1 and Week 5.  
The paper must be submitted in Week 7.

Each student must send the paper **by email** and also **deposit a printed copy** in my office mailbox before the end of Week 7.  
When sending the email, please use the following subject line:

**Email subject:** `Response Paper 1 – Political Economy of Globalization – [Your Full Name]`

Papers sent without the correct subject line may not be registered on time.

## What You Are Expected to Do

You will receive two readings that deal with a similar question or problem. Your task is to connect them through one clear analytical question. You should explain what each author tries to show, how they build their argument, and what we can learn by comparing them.

For example, if you receive Polanyi (1944) and Hayek (1945), you might ask:
> How do Polanyi and Hayek understand the relationship between markets and society, and what do their views reveal about the political meaning of economic freedom?

You begin by introducing your question and the two authors. You then reconstruct the main argument of the first reading, showing what problem it addresses and how. You move next to the second text, explaining how it supports, challenges, or extends the first argument. You conclude by summarizing what the comparison reveals about globalization.

## Structure

| Section | Content | Approximate length |
|----------|----------|--------------------|
| Introduction | Present your question and both readings. Explain why this comparison matters. | ~150 words |
| Main analysis | Explain the argument of the first author clearly and precisely. | ~400 words |
| Comparison | Discuss the second author in relation to the first. Show similarities or differences and their meaning. | ~350 words |
| Conclusion | Summarize what the comparison reveals and what you learned. | ~100 words |

## Example

> Polanyi and Hayek were both writing in response to the crises of capitalism in the early twentieth century, but they understood freedom in opposite ways. For Hayek, freedom depends on protecting markets from political interference. For Polanyi, freedom requires protecting society from the effects of unregulated markets. Comparing their views helps us understand how the idea of economic freedom has always involved a tension between market autonomy and social protection.

This example shows the level of reasoning expected: clear, structured, and focused on ideas rather than opinions.

## Evaluation

Your grade will be based on the following four criteria, each weighted equally.

| Criterion | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Clarity and structure | The essay follows a logical argument and is easy to read. |
| Understanding | You show that you understand the main ideas and reasoning of both authors. |
| Comparison | You connect the two texts thoughtfully and discuss what we learn from their differences or similarities. |
| Writing quality | The writing is clear, accurate, and respects the required format. |

A paper that simply summarizes both texts will not receive a high grade. A strong paper explains, compares, and reasons.

## Use of AI Tools

You may use AI tools to help with structure or phrasing, but only if this is declared.  
If you use any form of AI assistance, include at the end of your paper a short appendix titled **“AI Use Declaration”**, where you list the exact prompts or questions you used.  
This declaration will not affect your grade; it simply ensures transparency.  
You remain responsible for the accuracy, coherence, and originality of your final text.

## Final Advice

This exercise is meant to help you think carefully about ideas. Do not try to cover everything. Choose one clear question and develop it step by step. The best papers are simple, precise, and show that you have read carefully and thought seriously about the texts.

Reading is a collective effort in this course. Writing is personal.
