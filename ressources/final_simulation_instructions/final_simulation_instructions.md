# Final Simulation and Group Presentation (45%)

## Overview

This assignment represents 45% of the final grade. It combines analytical reasoning with practical simulation work. Students will prepare a **slide-based presentation** (instead of a written memo) that simulates an **international negotiation** on a key issue of globalization. The topic for this semester is:

**Globalization and Migration: Negotiating Global Rules for Labor Mobility**

The exercise reproduces the conditions of a real multilateral negotiation — similar to WTO or UN summits — where each group represents a distinct actor (state, regional bloc, or international organization) and defends its position on the governance of migration.

---

## Objective

The goal of this simulation is to use the theories studied throughout the course to analyze and defend a policy position. The exercise combines conceptual knowledge and negotiation strategy. It requires you to demonstrate how actors interpret and respond to globalization pressures, using the tools of comparative political economy.

You are expected to:
- Mobilize readings from the course to explain your actor’s reasoning.
- Present a coherent position and realistic proposals.
- Understand other actors’ interests and engage with them during the simulation.

The simulation mirrors how policymakers justify their positions using both theory and evidence.

## Group Composition and Roles

Students will form **groups of five**. Each group must select a **representative**, who will:
1. Submit the slides (digital and printed).
2. Deliver the 7-minute oral presentation during the final session.
3. Coordinate communication within the group.

All members contribute equally to research, writing, and slide design.

By **Wednesday, November 26, 2025**, each group must email the instructor:
- The **list of members**
- The **actor they will represent**

Actors will be distributed to ensure diversity of perspectives. Possible options include:

| Type of Actor | Examples |
|----------------|-----------|
| **Regional blocs** | European Union, African Union |
| **National governments** | Morocco, Bangladesh, United States |
| **International organizations** | ILO, IOM, WTO |
| **Civil society / NGOs** | Migrant Rights Coalition, Global Justice Network |

Each actor faces different incentives and constraints, which should shape its argument and policy proposals.

## Simulation Format

The simulation will take place during **Week 10 (final week of the semester)**.  
Each group will:
- Present for **7 minutes**, using slides (6–8 maximum).
- Engage in a **3-minute question and negotiation round** led by peers and the instructor.

You are expected to:
1. Present your actor’s position.
2. Respond briefly to other actors’ arguments.
3. Negotiate a potential point of consensus or disagreement.

The purpose is not to “win” but to show that you can reason politically and analytically under realistic negotiation conditions.

## Practical Details

### Submission
- The slides must be submitted **by Wednesday, December 17, 2025, before 21:00**.
- One **digital version** must be emailed to me.
- Email subject:  
  `Final Presentation – Political Economy of Globalization – Group [number]`
- One **printed copy** must be placed in the instructor’s office mailbox before the same deadline.

### Presentation Day
Each group will have access to the classroom computer. Slides must be in PDF format to avoid compatibility issues. The representative will present while other members stand ready to respond during discussion.

The group’s presentation should fit within the 7-minute limit; going beyond will result in point deductions.

## Slide Structure and Content

| Slide | Purpose | Guidance |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Title | Actor name, group members, course title, and date. |
| 2 | Executive overview | Two or three sentences summarizing your actor’s perspective on globalization and migration. |
| 3 | Problem and context | Briefly outline the issue (labor migration, inequality, sovereignty). Use 1–2 simple data visuals if helpful. |
| 4 | Analytical framework | Identify one or two theories from the course (e.g. Polanyi’s double movement, dependency theory, embedded liberalism, varieties of capitalism). Explain how they help interpret your actor’s position. |
| 5 | Actor’s position | Present your actor’s key argument and negotiation priorities. What does your actor want, and why? |
| 6 | Policy proposals | Offer 1–2 concrete, feasible policy measures (e.g., regional labor mobility agreements, global social standards, circular migration schemes). |
| 7 | Trade-offs and risks | Identify one central tension your actor faces and how it plans to manage it. |
| 8 | Conclusion | Summarize your actor’s stance and suggest one possible collective outcome of the negotiation. |

## Examples of Analytical Application

### Example 1 — European Union
- **Framework:** Polanyi’s double movement and embedded liberalism.
- **Interpretation:** The EU must reconcile open labor markets with social protection mechanisms.
- **Proposal:** A joint EU mechanism for migrant worker certification and compensation funds for regions under pressure.
- **Trade-off:** Economic flexibility vs. social legitimacy.

### Example 2 — Morocco
- **Framework:** Dependency and world-systems theory.
- **Interpretation:** Morocco depends on remittances and migration partnerships with Europe, but faces asymmetric power relations.
- **Proposal:** Negotiate co-development schemes and circular migration programs.
- **Trade-off:** Sovereignty vs. dependence on external financing.

### Example 3 — International Labour Organization (ILO)
- **Framework:** Embedded liberalism.
- **Interpretation:** Open markets can only be sustainable if balanced by global labor standards.
- **Proposal:** Create a “Global Labor Compact” ensuring minimum social protections.
- **Trade-off:** Broad participation vs. compliance capacity of low-income states.

## Using Course Material

You are expected to **explicitly use the course readings and theories** to build your argument.  
Below are examples of how specific readings can be mobilized:

| Week | Reading | How to Use It |
|------|----------|---------------|
| 2 | Polanyi (1944) | To explain tensions between market openness and social protection. |
| 2 | Cardoso & Faletto (1979), Wallerstein (2011) | To analyze dependence between sending and receiving countries. |
| 3 | Hall & Soskice (2013) | To discuss institutional differences in labor market responses. |
| 4 | Ruggie (1982), Helleiner (2006) | To interpret international cooperation under “embedded liberalism.” |
| 5 | Broome, Clegg & Rethel (2012) | To describe how global institutions coordinate or compete during crises. |
| 6 | Brady, Beckfield & Seeleib-Kaiser (2005) | To analyze the impact of globalization on welfare systems. |
| 7 | Reilly (2014) | To show how authoritarian regimes use migration to maintain stability. |
| 9 | Franzese (2019), Teney et al. (2014) | To discuss the populist backlash and perceptions of “losers” of globalization. |

When quoting, use the format (Author, Year) and limit references to key points that support your reasoning.
